1a) Total number of canine students = 80537

1b) Read in text file into python, looped through the entries stripping new lines and inserting each line into a list via splitting on "<^>". Then put it in a data frame and removed duplicates and returned the total.

1c) Arrived at total two ways, first used a set in previous submission and this time just dropped duplicates and since all of the students are dogs, I took the total of the rows.

2a) List is file3.csv. Can also be viewed in the notebook.

3a) I created sets containing all of the zip codes in those particular regions and stored the Mixed/Others information in regional lists and then taking the size of the lists. Some type casting had to be done. Staten Island had the fewest registrations by "Mixed/Other," followed by The Bronx.

4a) In zipcode_region_ranges there were two ranges for Queens which had to be accounted for. There were quotation marks that had to be filtered out in most of the files and there were two hidden or special characters that survived the data cleaning. There were also some values for names missing.
